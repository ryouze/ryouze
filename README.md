## About Me

I am a machine learning engineer with over three years of experience in applied ML and software development.

I currently work at [EPR Labs](https://epr-labs.com), where I develop software and data pipelines for training, evaluating, and deploying predictive and generative ML models in Python.

Previously, during a three-year paid research internship at the [PRODIS project](https://prodis-opus19.github.io), I built and maintained the full machine learning and data processing stack. My work included developing the first [phoneme-level GPT model for Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112), CI pipelines for survey processing, GUI transcription QA tools, a batch ASR wrapper, and a web interface for data collection.

Outside of work, I develop cross-platform C++ applications and maintain a Linux home server for self-hosting.
